        <p>In the early morning of 11 April 2024, a young man aged 21, with the screen name Fat Cat, chose to jump from a bridge into the Yangtze River .......
            Fat Cat was a game substitute before he was born, and his main job was to earn income by playing games for others. He and a 27-year-old woman Tan met on the Internet and fell deeply in love. For the sake of this love affair, Fat Cat went far away from his hometown and came to Chongqing to live with Tan. However, Tan's feelings for the fat cat is not as "deep" as he thought.
            In the fat cat for this love affair paid up to 510,000 yuan price, Tan Mou is about to honour the promise of marriage with the fat cat before the break-up. Faced with the emotional and financial double blow, the fat cat finally chose the extreme way to end it all.
            As events unfold, the truth gradually emerges. A lot of details have reversed: First, Tan is not a feelings of liar and fat cat with real identity more than two years of intercourse, and see each other friends and relatives; Second, Tan is not the name of love to "fat cat" to ask for money, the two sides of the economy each other, does not constitute a crime of fraud; Third, the "fat cat Third, the "fat cat" sister is not simply for the brother to seek justice, there are planning net violence and other behaviours.</p>
        <h2>Emily (27): "This is so heartbreaking. Fat Cat clearly loved Tan deeply, but it's important to have a balanced and equal relationship. If Tan didn't feel the same anymore, she wasn't obligated to marry him. Women also have the right to choose their own happiness."</h2>
        <h3>Sarah (32): "We shouldn't jump to conclusions. The details show Tan wasn't a scammer. Relationships can be complicated, and it seems there were misunderstandings on both sides. Women also need to protect themselves in relationships."</h3>
        <h4>Rachel (25): "Fat Cat's sister planning online violence is wrong. It's a difficult situation, but responding with more negativity isn't the solution. This highlights the importance of mental health support, especially when relationships break down."</h4>
        <h5>Jessica (29): "This is a sad story, but we can't ignore that Fat Cat's expectations might have been too high. Emotional and financial investments should be mutual and not based on pressure or guilt. Women need to maintain rationality and self-respect in relationships."</h5>
