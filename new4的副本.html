        <h2>"Please, play something better... How did this art quality get past the review? Is the art supervisor fucking blind?"</h2>
        <h3> "Well, well, well, looks like someone's got a mouth full of toxic sludge. Did you take a wrong turn on your way to the misogynistic troll convention, or did you just forget to check your Neanderthal attitude at the door? Let's not pretend your caveman commentary adds anything of value to the conversation. Maybe instead of spewing bile, you could try recognizing that women can excel in art just as much as men, if not more. But hey, if your tiny brain can't handle that concept, maybe stick to grunting in your cave instead of polluting the internet with your backward views. 👊👩‍🎨"</h3>
