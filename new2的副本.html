        <h1>Lifelong infertility increases with higher levels of female education</h1>
        <p>Professor Jiang Quanbao of the Institute of Population and Development at Xi'an Jiaotong University and researcher at the China Population and Development Research Centre (CPDRC) have released at BMJ Open
            - "Rising trend of childlessness in China.

            The paper, "Rising trend of childlessness in China: Analysis of social and regional disparities with 2010 and 2020 census data", examines the factors associated with the rise in female infertility between 2010 and 2020 and predicts the future trend of the rate, providing data to support policy implementation. The study concludes with a prediction that lifetime infertility among urban and tertiary-educated women will continue to rise, exceeding 10 per cent. As urbanisation accelerates and tertiary education becomes more widely available, the number of women with lifelong infertility will increase more rapidly.</p>
        <h2>Michael (34): "This study reveals an important issue. As more women pursue higher education and career development, they delay or forgo childbirth, which negatively impacts society. Perhaps women should consider family responsibilities more instead of solely focusing on their careers. After all, having children is crucial for the sustainable development of society."</h2>
        <h3>David (28): "It's concerning to see the rise in infertility rates among urban and highly educated women. While education and career opportunities are important, women shouldn't neglect their reproductive responsibilities. Too many women choose careers over family, which adversely affects the population structure. Society should encourage women to marry and have children earlier."</h3>
        <h4>Chris (40): "The results of this study highlight the drawbacks of women pursuing higher education and careers. Women focusing too much on their careers leads to higher infertility and lower birth rates. Perhaps we should re-examine the impact of education and careers on women, encouraging them to return to family roles and have more children to maintain societal balance."</h4>
