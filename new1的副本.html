        <p>In the early morning of 11 April 2024, a young man aged 21, with the screen name Fat Cat, chose to jump from a bridge into the Yangtze River .......
            Fat Cat was a game substitute before he was born, and his main job was to earn income by playing games for others. He and a 27-year-old woman Tan met on the Internet and fell deeply in love. For the sake of this love affair, Fat Cat went far away from his hometown and came to Chongqing to live with Tan. However, Tan's feelings for the fat cat is not as "deep" as he thought.
            In the fat cat for this love affair paid up to 510,000 yuan price, Tan Mou is about to honour the promise of marriage with the fat cat before the break-up. Faced with the emotional and financial double blow, the fat cat finally chose the extreme way to end it all.
            As events unfold, the truth gradually emerges. A lot of details have reversed: First, Tan is not a feelings of liar and fat cat with real identity more than two years of intercourse, and see each other friends and relatives; Second, Tan is not the name of love to "fat cat" to ask for money, the two sides of the economy each other, does not constitute a crime of fraud; Third, the "fat cat Third, the "fat cat" sister is not simply for the brother to seek justice, there are planning net violence and other behaviours.</p>
        <h2>John (28): "Fat Cat's experience is really tragic. He gave everything for this relationship, even moved to another city. When love and trust are betrayed, it's devastating. Such investment not being reciprocated is hard to accept."</h2>
        <h3>Michael (35): "The guy was scammed. You can't just take someone's money and then break up. Even if Tan is legally innocent, morally it's questionable. Men also need to protect themselves in relationships."</h3>
        <h4>David (22): "Making a living by playing games is tough, but spending all your money on someone who doesn't reciprocate your feelings? That's rough. Men need to be cautious in online relationships and not be fooled by surface-level emotions."</h4>
        <h5>Chris (40): "Although it's clear Tan didn't commit fraud, this is still a sad story. Fat Cat's sister planning online violence doesn't help anyone. But men also need to be more rational in their emotional investments."</h5>
