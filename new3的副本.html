        <h1>I've had enough. I've had another fight with my husband over the housework.</h1>
        <p>Are all men in Fujian so macho?
            Hubby just leaves after dinner.
            He just leaves the bowls there and doesn't wash them.
            He thinks the woman should do all the housework. If this goes on, the relationship will fade.</p>
        <h2>"You women are not considerate of men at all. Do you know how tiring it is for men to work outside? Just do it yourself and bother us."</h2>
        <h3>"The man earns money outside and the woman does the housework inside. The division of labour is well established."</h3>
        <h4>”What a laugh. You guys don't do this, you don't do that, what the hell can you do. I say there would be no need for any more women's benefits, they have no right to them.“</h4>
