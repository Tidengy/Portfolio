        <h1>Is this your reason for not getting married?</h1>
        <p>In this day and age, more and more young people are choosing to live independently and enjoy the freedom of being single, but parents often have their own expectations and anxieties, and pushing for marriage has become the norm in many families.
            What I want to say is that everyone has their own pace of life and choices. Marriage is not a race and there is no need to compare progress with others. We all have our own dreams and pursuits, and sometimes those dreams don't include getting married and having children at a particular age.
            However, it is not unreasonable for parents to push for marriage. They want us to have a partner who can support each other and share the joys and sorrows of life.
            This concern and expectation is something we should understand and respect.
            I would like to say that no matter what kind of lifestyle we choose, the important thing is to be happy. Marriage is not the whole of life, we should respect our own choices and at the same time understand the concern of our parents. Let's find our own happiness in this colourful world! I wish everyone can find the right other half for them!</p>

        <h3>"Nowadays, the bride price is so expensive that who can afford to get married? If the policy can be passed to abolish the bride price, I can consider it."</h3>
        <h4>"Is it because we don't want to tie the knot? Why don't you ask those women how long they're going to hold us?"</h4>
