        <h1>Lifelong infertility increases with higher levels of female education</h1>
        <p>Professor Jiang Quanbao of the Institute of Population and Development at Xi'an Jiaotong University and researcher at the China Population and Development Research Centre (CPDRC) have released at BMJ Open
            - "Rising trend of childlessness in China.

            The paper, "Rising trend of childlessness in China: Analysis of social and regional disparities with 2010 and 2020 census data", examines the factors associated with the rise in female infertility between 2010 and 2020 and predicts the future trend of the rate, providing data to support policy implementation. The study concludes with a prediction that lifetime infertility among urban and tertiary-educated women will continue to rise, exceeding 10 per cent. As urbanisation accelerates and tertiary education becomes more widely available, the number of women with lifelong infertility will increase more rapidly.</p>
        <h2>Chloe (31): "While this study shows a rising trend in infertility, I don't believe it's due to women's education and career development. Instead, it indicates the need for more policy support to help women achieve both career goals and family life. The government should provide more childcare support, flexible working arrangements, and maternity leave policies."</h2>
        <h3>Sophia (29): "The issue isn't women's education; it's the lack of policies supporting women's reproductive and family lives. The government should offer more support, such as flexible work arrangements and better childcare options, to help women balance careers and family responsibilities."</h3>
        <h4>Jessica (35): "The rise in infertility rates isn't because women pursue higher education, but because society lacks adequate protections for women. We need better healthcare facilities, the promotion of healthy lifestyles, and family-friendly work environments to support women's reproductive choices."</h4>
